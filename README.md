# Welcome_Pack
## Welcome Pack for the Computing Department
In addition to the provided reading list, the various training videos and texts below are to introduce you to the basics of the programming languages to be used during your course.   If you are comfortable with them, some of the links may not apply to you and advanced study links have been provided, where applicable.  Transcripts are available on all video sites.  You will not need to download the various software for the programmes (umless you already have them).  This is because you will be using a web-based IDE for all the programming languages and database queries during your course.  

#### R 
https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-r-for-data-science-3 
For advanced programmers needing to understand R, take a look at “Advanced R” or “R for Data Science” both by Hadley Wickham

#### Python
https://www.learnpython.org/ - Beginners, focus on “Learn the Basics” and “Data Science Tutorials”.
Or https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/
To practice, please use the Python shell - https://www.python.org/shell/

#### SQL 
https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/sql

#### GitHub (you will need to create a student GitHub account once you complete your programme registration)
https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/ and https://youtu.be/noZnOSpcjYY  
The [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) book by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub  is also a good guide as you delve into gits.

#### Probability and Statistics 
To help you brush up on these topics, please visit the [StatsTutor site](http://www.statstutor.ac.uk/topics/) and the [Khan Academy site](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-statistics#prepare-for-the-2019-ap-statistics-exam) that both cover all the key topics in this module.

**You may find it helpful to keep referring to these resources throughout your programme.  A note of these will be made available on the Induction Module on the Moodle platform (_What will I need for my studies?_).**

### Key Computer Science Concepts
Below are notes to help you review some key Computer Science concepts before you start your postgraduate programme.  This covers type safety, evaluation rules, and the style guides for the various languages.

#### Type Safety
This is a key issue as It prevents (or even discourages) data type errors.  You will come across these during the course (and we’re sure you’ve seen a few in your time programming so far).  The style guides below, as well as the introductory information above, have some information on data types.  Chapter 4 of Vlad Riscutia’s book, [“Programming with Types”](https://www.manning.com/books/programming-with-types) elaborates fully on this topic and the TypeScript [website](http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/basic-types.html) has more information on the different types.  You will need to review this information carefully throughout your programme, especially if you are not comfortable with a particular programming language.  

#### Evaluation Rules 
Every programming language has its own evaluation rules for function arguments, such as if else clauses in Python, to end in a True statement/clause.  Ensure you familiarise yourself with these rules in the programming languages stated for this course.

#### Style Guides
There is a need to be consistent in the style you use when writing code.  The consistent style ensures that your code is:
-	Understandable
-	Amendable
-	Reusable
-	Sustainable

Group work is a key aspect of a data science practitioner’s everyday work life.  So, it is essential to ensure you have a consistent style, whichever coding language you use.  During the course, this will help to ensure your group can collaborate efficiently on projects.  It will also ensure that your work can be assessed correctly by your peers and tutors.  

Most organisations have their own guides for the various programming languages used in a project.  One commonly used source for Python is [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).  However, if you are a beginner, this might be a difficult document to read.  A simplified version can be found [here](https://pep8.org/).  

For SQL, [SQL style guide](https://www.sqlstyle.guide/) by Simon Holywell is widely used.  Finally, for R, [tiddyverse](https://style.tidyverse.org/) is a popular style guide, which is based on the [Google Style Guides](http://google.github.io/styleguide/).   If you would like to review the Google Style Guides for the coding languages discussed, you can start by focusing on sections covering:
-	Indentation
-	Maximum line length
-	Line spacing
-	Imports
-	Whitespace
-	Naming Conventions
-	Comments
-	Quotes
-	Compound Statements
