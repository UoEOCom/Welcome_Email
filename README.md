# Welcome to the Computing Department
### Practical Application
In addition to the provided reading list you were sent, the various videos and weblinks below are to introduce you to the basics of the programming languages to be used during your course.   If you are comfortable with them, some of the links may not apply to you and advanced study links have been provided, where applicable.  Transcripts are available on all video sites given.  

You will not need to download the various software for the programmes (unless you already have them).  This is because you will be using a web-based IDE for all the programming languages and database queries used during your course.  

#### GitHub (Used in all courses.  You will need to create a student GitHub account once you complete your course registration)
https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/ and the GitHub YouTube channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP7RrmoueENv9TZts3HXXtw

#### Python (Used in most courses, including object-oriented programming)
https://www.learnpython.org/ - Beginners, focus on “Learn the Basics” and “Data Science Tutorials”.  
To practice, please use the [Python shell](https://www.python.org/shell/) or https://codingbat.com/python

#### SQL (Used in modules involving databases)
https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/sql

#### Java (Also helps you understand object-oriented programming)
https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/java-tutorial-downloads-2005894.html  
An online practice space - https://codingbat.com/java

#### R (Sometimes used in tandem with Python, especially for Mathematical programming)
https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-r-for-data-science-3 amd https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/  
For advanced programmers needing to understand R, take a look at [“Advanced R”](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/) or [“R for Data Science”](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/), both by Hadley Wickham.

#### C/C++ (Used in some object-oriented programming modules)
https://www.learn-c.org/ and https://www.learn-cpp.org/ cater to both beginners and advaced programmers.  Take a look at 
https://www.cprogramming.com/ as well for more practice.  
Advanced programmers, take a look at http://www.icce.rug.nl/documents/cplusplus/.  

**You may find it helpful to keep referring to these resources throughout your course.  A link to this page will also be made available on your induction module on the learning platform.**

### Key Computer Science Concepts
Below are notes to help you review some key Computer Science concepts before you start your programme.  This covers type safety, evaluation rules, and the style guides for the various languages.

* #### Computing Fundamentals
https://introcomputing.org/ This site from Stanford University's Introductory Course descibes the nature of computers and also provides a platform fo you to practice.  
https://composingprograms.com/  This site offers more text on covering the fundamental aspects of programming and computer science. 

* #### Style Guides
There is a need to be consistent in the style you use when writing code.  The consistent style ensures that your code is:
   -	Understandable
   -	Amendable
   -	Reusable
   -	Sustainable

Group/team work is a key aspect of a computer science practitioner’s everyday work life.  So, it is essential to ensure you have a consistent style, whichever coding language you use.  During the course, this will help to ensure your group can collaborate efficiently on projects.  It will also ensure that your work can be assessed correctly by your peers and tutors.  

Most organisations have their own guides for the various programming languages used in a project.  One commonly used source for Python is [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).  However, if you are a beginner, this might be a difficult document to read.  A simplified version can be found [here](https://pep8.org/).  

For SQL, [SQL style guide](https://www.sqlstyle.guide/) by Simon Holywell is widely used.  Finally, for R, [tiddyverse](https://style.tidyverse.org/) is a popular style guide, which is based on the [Google Style Guides](http://google.github.io/styleguide/).   If you would like to review the Google Style Guides for the coding languages discussed, you can start by focusing on sections covering:
-	Indentation
-	Maximum line length
-	Line spacing
-	Imports
-	Whitespace
-	Naming Conventions
-	Comments
-	Quotes
-	Compound Statements

These are areas where mistakes commonly occur, making it difficult for team members to follow your code or creates issues with adaptation (even for you!) later down the line.

* #### Debugging 
A dreaded process by most computer programmers but highly essential to your work.  It refers to the process of interpreting and diagnosing the cause of errors in your programme.  John DeNero descibes the process of debugging quite succinctly on his [website](https://composingprograms.com/pages/11-getting-started.html#errors).

### Finally,
Please remember that your tutor is on hand to help you with your programming queries.  You can also learn a lot from other students as you all bring to the course varying expertise from diverse educational and professional backgrounds.

Welcome again to the University of Essex Online Computing Department.  We look forward to working with you all.
